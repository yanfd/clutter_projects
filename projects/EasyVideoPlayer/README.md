# EasyVideoPlayer

This script plays the images of a video with OpenCV and the audio of a video with ffpyplayer. There is no need to change the code to play different videos, the script finds the video you want in your pc and changes its working directory automatically.

## Things To Improve

- You need keyboard interrupt from the terminal to close the script right now. This can be improved.
- There is no pause button right now.
- If the video is somehow paused when the right click is pressed from the button, the audio and video becomes out of sync.
