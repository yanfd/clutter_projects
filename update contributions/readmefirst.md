# Script sequence:

- run the standardize_project_name script first to rename all project folders
- push the updated names to the repo
- then run update_readme script to update the contributions.md file with updated project names


## Decisons:

- api call is usedi instead of gitlog or direct frontend requests due to speed and accuracy factor
- two different scripts are written to remove dependency
- contributions.md file is wrriten now will later can be merged into main readme


### Suggestions:

- suggetions are welcome
